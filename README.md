## This repo showcases various work product samples; it is a way to highlight my versatile skillset and dedication to producing pragmatic and high-quality solutions

To give some background/context, I received my Petroleum Engineering degree from UT - Austin, but my fascination for Business and strategy led me to take a Business Consultant job out of college. From there, I parlayed that experience into a District Management role for an Oil and Gas Wireline Service provider. While we were successful in growing the West Texas district (significant top and bottom-line expansion, improved safety and quality metrics), Odessa was not a place I wanted to call home. Hence, I decided to take some time off to snowboard and explore my other interests. Then, COVID hit...

I enrolled in the Data Science program at Springboard. I immediately fell in love with the process of uncovering incredible insights from data. Data is like an abstract canvas; one where the artist attempts to accurately curate an inituitive story for their audience. I continue to develop my python, machine learning, statistics and analytical skills in my spare time.

Over the course of 2021 and 2022, I've worked for Reali (prop tech) and "The Fikes Companies". My work primarily entailed the following:
  - data sourcing (ETL), pipeline generation (API) and management, data analytics/visualization development (SpotFire and Looker) and process improvement
  - interfacing with stakeholders to identify and prioritize needs and their associated impact
  - troubleshooting the development and production environments (GITHUB/DBT, Snowflake)
  - data discovery and cleansing (e.g. leveraging Mixpanel and Segment data to develop customer attribution statistics)
  - succinctly informing/transferring knowledge learned from the data (corner cases, caveats, holes, etc.)
